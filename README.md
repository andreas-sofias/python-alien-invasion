# python-alien-invasion
A version of the Alien Invasion game. Based on the tutorial on the Python Crash Course book with some extensions I wrote myself.

In a command line type "python3 alien_invasion.py" to start the game. 

You can move the ship left and right with the left and right keys. Shoot a laser beam with SPACE. You can exit by pressing the 'Q' key.  

-Extensions 
 * Music and sound effects deploymen via the PYGAME library.
 * Can start the game also by pressing 'p' when the PLAY button emerges

- TODO
  * Change the background in a space related theme.
  * Making the high score permanent via reading/write data on a file
  * Implement boss fights
  * Making a "faster" and "slower" functions with the UP and DOWN keys.
